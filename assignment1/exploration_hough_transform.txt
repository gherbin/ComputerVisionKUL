situation 1 
param1 = 88
param2 = 36
minDist = 15
minRadius = 1
maxRadius = 91
=> plant, orchidea, card
------------------------------
Increasing the threshold param1 decreases the amount of circles detected

decreasing minDist, interesting area is on the left, around the leaf. inner circles are detected


param1 = 88
param2 = 30
minDist = 80
minRadius = 10
maxRadius = 91
=> decrease threshold accumulator (param2) : much more circles; 
=> interesting to increase the minimal distance between detected circles
=> Much more circles, plant + orchidea + apple + several circles on the painting and birthday cards

	
decreasing again accumulator param2 to 22
> more fruits
> more in plants, ...
=> more not real circles


param1 = 154
param2 = 28
minDist = 80 ===> 1
minRadius = 10
maxRadius = 91
=> plant, orchidea, card

much more detection on the same place

If we want to be much more selective:
=> apple ! 
=> set radius around target radius (38 -> 60)
=> min distance between centers ~= 17
=> param2 = 24


===================
dp = 2
param 1 = 167
param 2 = 73
minDist = 52
minRadius = 28
maxRadius = 90
