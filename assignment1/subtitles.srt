00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:00,999
Geoffroy Herbin - Computer Vision - Assignment 1

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:01,999
switch between color and grayscale

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,999
Gaussian filters

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,999
Bilateral filters

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,999
Gaussian vs Bilateral filters

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,999
[Left] Gaussian = blurry
[Right] Bilateral = edge preserving

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,899
RGB colorspace

00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,999
RGB colorspace grabbing using thresholding (tentative)

9
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,499
HSV colorspace

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,499
red = opening, green = dilatation, blue = closing

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,999
Calibration view - Sobel edge detection


00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,499
Hough Transform 
Parameters first chosen to isolate plant leaf

00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,499
<i>MinDist</i> very small: multiple circles very close

00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:29,499
Accumulator <i>param2</i> lower: more (noisy) circles detected
(according to radius boundaries set)

00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,899
Edge detection parameter <i>param1</i> lower: more detections

00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,999
Different set of parameters allow tuning towards specific target
<i> Canny edge detection output shown </i>


00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,999
Object found using template matching technique ( <i>CCOEFF_NORMED</i> )

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,999
Brightest point has the highest probability of matching the template

00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:41,499
Same scene, 3 yellow hockey balls

00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,999
Let's track those balls on fire!


00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:52,999
<i>Goal Line Assistance </i>


00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,999
Simple hockey rule: ball must cross entirely the line to score
