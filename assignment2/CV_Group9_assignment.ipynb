This involves the choice of an *optimal* $p$, number of components used, which is a trade-off between information loss and dimensionality reduction. We discussed abundantly this topic and showed one way to choose $p$. \n",

Many parameters allow to tune the robustness to noise, to lighting condition, or the \"granularity\" of the representation. \n",
